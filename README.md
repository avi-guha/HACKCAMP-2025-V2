# ToneLens

## What is it?
ToneLens is a lightweight text-analysis app designed to help users understand how their messages might be perceived. By detecting emotional tone, intent, and subtle cues in written text, ToneLens gives instant feedback so you can communicate more clearly and confidently. Whether you're drafting a sensitive message or just curious how you sound, ToneLens helps ensure your words match your meaning.

## For NwHacks Judges: 
Because we have used a Gemini API key that will probably turn to shit when we try to push to git due to privacy leaks, we are requesting that you follow the steps below: 

1. Generate an Gemini API key if you have not already.
2. Create a text file with the name '.env.local' in the root. 
3. Enter the following text in your new file: 'GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key'
4. npm install, npm run genkit:dev, npm run dev.
5. Detect tones!
